 ### Description
 
 Note Taker is an application that can be used to write and save notes. The application uses an [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file. When the user opens the Note Taker, the user is presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page. On the notes page, the user is presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the noteâ€™s text in the right-hand column.
